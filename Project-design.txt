How will you design a project?

1. Understand exact requirement, timeline, business value.
2. Think about the challenges, approach and estimates.

3. Challenges - 
  a) Figure out complexity of the app.
  b) Is it serving big loads like images and videos?
  c) What would be the total and concurrent users accessing app?
  d) How are we gonna deal with huge data exchanges and how we can minimize that?
  e) How would we manage user authentication?

4. Approach - Decide and implement following factors:
  a. What will be the best tech stack and implement intial technical setup.
  b. Which environments to be supported - Dev, prod, qa, etc?
  c. How are we going to implement and maintain user authentication and validation across app?
  d. How will we implement application architecture and state management?
  e. How are we getting data and consuming it in app? (Do we need adapters)
  f. What would be database architecture?
  g. Is app going to be monolithic or micro services based?
  h. How are we implementing state management?
  i. Error handling across app.
  j. How are we going to deploy the app? (Docker, Qubernetes)
  k. Do we need to add load balancers?
