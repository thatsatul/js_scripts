How to improve performance of the application?

Front-end
1. Minification of CSS and JS files
2. Lazy-loading of modules
3. Resize images according to platform
4. Less number of http requests
5. Avoid render blocking css
6. Use async and defer JS
7. Apply pagination for large data.
8. Caching of non-changing data
9. Bring data dynamically as we progress in page (eg. lazy load images on scrolling )
10. Decrease the size of http request and response.
11. Preconnect client to api server for establishing handshake
12. Handle errors properly (http errors, data errors, navigation errors)
13. Separate api calls based on different sections in UI. So that later get loaded parallely.
14. Implement chunking

Back-end:
1. Caching ( redis, memcache )
2. Try to lessen the query count to DB as performing repeated db connections add latency
3. Handle errors properly
4. Optimize the query.
5. Load-balancing of servers for handling large number of server requests

Database:

1. Partitioning of database with similar data together
2. Using indexing in DB
